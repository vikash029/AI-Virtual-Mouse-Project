# AI Virtual Mouse Project

## Overview

The AI Virtual Mouse Project is designed to create a virtual mouse controlled by artificial intelligence. This project leverages machine learning techniques to interpret user inputs and perform mouse operations, providing an intuitive and hands-free way to interact with a computer.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Control**: Uses machine learning algorithms to control the mouse cursor based on user gestures or voice commands.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects and interprets hand movements or gestures to perform mouse clicks and movements.
- **Voice Commands**: Allows for mouse control through voice commands for enhanced accessibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, etc.
- A webcam for gesture recognition (if applicable)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikash029/AI-Virtual-Mouse-Project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd AI-Virtual-Mouse-Project
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure your webcam is connected and working.
   - Configure any necessary environment variables or settings in the `config` folder.

2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Gesture Control**: Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate your gestures. Move your hand in the defined patterns to control the cursor.
- **Voice Commands**: Speak into the microphone to issue commands like "click" or "scroll."
